Formatting:
        Look at the formatting of what already exists. Do your best to mimic it. If
    you're modifying an already existing file, you must stay consistent with
    the formatting of that file. If you're creating your own file from scratch,
    try to stay consistent with the formatting of the project.
  
  - Must keep formatting within files consistent
  
  - Try to keep formatting across project reasonably consistent
  
  - Identation: 4 spaces. No tabs. FOUR SPACES. This is a project-wide rule, not
    a per-file rule.
    
  - If the code is logic-heavy, it needs comments.

Miscellaneous:

  - Makefile will remain -O3 with no debugging/profiling flags. You can have
    whatever you please in your repo, but I won't pull a -O0 -g -pg Makefile.
    
  - This is obviously one application where speed is very important, AND when
    we are ready to optimize we will. But, for now, clear and functional code
    is ALWAYS more important than fast code.
    
  - It is always safer to use the overloaded operators for Word than to try and
    deal with masks/words yourself. It also means that any improvements later on
    will be reciprocated throughout the code. Use the overloaded operators
    whenever possible.
